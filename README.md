#### If it comes to the final presentation, it was created in google presentations tool and exporting it to the pdf format didn't give satisfying results, therefore I put a link to it's original version on google (readonly) [presentation link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jDdCxDBgRbj2v_bsMLjHhi6nwHpVOkDBT6QctCHsS0I/edit?usp=sharing)
